    🏋️\u{200D}♂️ 📚 Growing Elm Modules - Group Coaching Program

Would you like to develop skills to help you with the following challenges?

|> List
    - What does the process of architecture look like for an in elm?
    - How do know which parts of your elm code to split out and organize together?
    - How do you keep your app easy to change and hard to break as you grow your non-trivial single-page apps?
    - How do you make working with new elm libraries manageable?
    - How can you use types to fix bugs and prevent new bugs?


In my Growing Elm Modules program, you will develop the habits and skills to address these issues head-on. Because the program is structured around group coaching and battle-tested lessons and exercises, the program is relatively high on learning commitment, and relatively low on financial commitment. You'll come away with more than a knowledge dump. You'll come away with real skills and real improvements to your codebase.

You'll learn through several mediums:

|> List
    - Group coaching calls every week
    - Drills to practice core skills
    - Exercises to apply to improve your codebase and get feedback in coaching hours
    - Slack chat with your peers in your program

The program is limited to 5 people, which means you get a good balance of coaching on your specific issues, and learning from other developer's experiences.
