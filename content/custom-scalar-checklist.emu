    How to improve your schema with Custom Scalars

    What

Use Custom Scalars instead of GraphQL primitives.

Instead of:

|> Code
    type Book {
      publicationDate: String!
      priceInCents: Int!

      # cover assets are stored at
      # `/covers/<coverImage>?format=<large|small>`
      coverImage: String!

      averageRating: Float!
      id: String!
    }

Try using Custom Scalars like this:

|> Code
    type Book {
      publicationDate: DateTime!
      price: USD!
      coverImage: CoverImage!
      averageRating: StarRating!
      id: BookId!
    }

    When


|> List
    - You want to transform the value into a particular data structure (e.g. Custom Scalar `DateTime`{code} -> Elm `Time`{code})
    - You want to ensure that a value is not mixed up and passed in where it has the same primitive representation but different semantic meaning (for example, `ProductId`{code} and `UserId`{code} might both be Strings, but if they are Custom Scalars then `elm-graphql`{code} can prevent you from passing in the wrong type.
    - You want to control *how* the data is used. For example a `Temperature`{code} or `USD`{code} Custom Scalar has implementation details (perhaps `USD`{code} is represented in cents, but you don't want to leak that knowledge all over your codebase, you want to keep it in one central location).

|> H2
    Why


*Custom Scalars are a way of representing a contract.*

For example, a `DateTime`{code} is just a `String`{code} under the hood. But there is a contract. When I call a value a `DateTime`{code}, I am promising that you will always be able to parse it as an ISO-8601 String (or however it is represented in your API).

The data in your GraphQL response will actually be the same. But by using the `DateTime`{code} Custom Scalar,  you are telling  `elm-graphql`{code} that it is safe to use it in a specific way. In this case, it may be that it can parse it as an ISO-8601 String.

Some other examples would be representing Currency (perhaps `USD`{code}). Again, the underlying representative is just a GraphQL primitive, but you've now given it semantic meaning. And `elm-graphql`{code} is able to take this semantic meaning and turn it into a specific type.

|> H2
    Custom Scalars for Ids


GraphQL provides a type called `Id`{code}. I recommend ignoring this type and instead creating a Custom Scalar to represent each type of Id in your domain. For example `ProductId`{code} or `UserId`{code}.

Why bother?

|> List
    - Nice clear information in the documentation for free
    - Elm can prevent you from passing in a `UserId`{code} where the API requires a `ProductId`{code}

|> H2
    Custom Scalars as Gate Keepers


Custom Scalars also provide a pinch point that allows you to limit all the knowledge about how to use a certain type to a single place. For example, you can use an Opaque Type to make sure that the only way `USD`{code} is displayed is by asking the `USD.elm`{code} module to display it for you. This gives you confidence that the knowledge of how to turn the underlying data representation for `USD`{code} is not leaked throughout your codebase, which reduces bugs and makes it easier to reason about your code.

If you're not using the Custom Scalar Codecs functionality in `elm-graphql`{code}. Take a look at the official [Custom Scalar Codecs example and instructions]{link| url = https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/blob/master/examples/src/Example07CustomCodecs.elm }.


Here's an example illustrating this with `USD`{code}.

|> Code
    module USD exposing (USD, codec, toString)


    import Graphql.Codec exposing (Codec)
    import Json.Decode exposing (Decoder)
    import Json.Encode


    type USD
        = Dollars Int


    codec : Codec USD
    codec =
        { encoder = encode
        , decoder = decoder
        }


    decoder : Decoder USD
    decoder =
        Json.Decode.map Dollars Json.Decode.int


    encode : USD -> Json.Encode.Value
    encode (Dollars  dollars) =
        Json.Encode.int dollars


    toString : USD -> String
    toString (Dollars  dollars ) =
        "$" ++ String.fromInt dollars
