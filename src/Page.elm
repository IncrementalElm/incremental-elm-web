Your team has got the hang of Elm. Now it's time to take it to the next level.

You might want to keep reading if:

| List
    - You want your team to write elm code faster, and to keep writing it fast as your codebase grows.
    - You want your senior devs to spend their time applying elm best practices, not *figuring them out*.
    - You want expert guidance, proven elm techniques, and battle-tested learning material to level up your elm team and codebase fast.

If you're a do-it-yourself kind of person, look no further! You can level up with my Weekly Mastering Elm Tips right now.

    How I can help your team level up

I save your team time by teaching techniques to write elm like an expert. Spoiler alert: the elm experts don't make it look easy by working their brains really hard. They know how to let the elm compiler do its job so they can look smart with minimal effort. And you can learn the skills and principles to build elm apps with fewer bugs and less effort, too.

    How to improve your schema with Custom Scalars

| Subheader
    What

Use Custom Scalars instead of GraphQL primitives.

Instead of:

| Monospace
    type Book {
      publicationDate: String!

      # cover assets are stored at
      # `/covers/<coverImage>?format=<large|small>`
      coverImage: String!

      averageRating: Float!
      id: String!
    }

Try using Custom Scalars like this:
| Monospace
    type Book {
      publicationDate: DateTime!
      coverImage: CoverImage!
      averageRating: StarRating!
      id: BookId!
    }

| Subheader
    When

| List
    - You want to transform the value into a particular data structure (e.g. Custom Scalar {Code|DateTime} -> Elm {Code|Time})
    - You want to ensure that a value is not mixed up and passed in where it has the same primitive representation but different semantic meaning (for example, {Code|ProductId} and {Code|UserId} might both be Strings, but if they are Custom Scalars then {Code|elm-graphql} can prevent you from passing in the wrong type.
    - You want to control *how* the data is used. For example a {Code|Temperature} or {Code|USD} Custom Scalar has implementation details (perhaps {Code|USD} is represented in cents, but you don't want to leak that knowledge all over your codebase, you want to keep it in one central location).

| Subheader
    Why

*Custom Scalars are a way of representing a contract.*

For example, a {Code|DateTime} is just a {Code|String} under the hood. But there is a contract. When I call a value a {Code|DateTime}, I am promising that you will always be able to parse it as an ISO-8601 String (or however it is represented in your API).

The data in your GraphQL response will actually be the same. But by using the {Code|DateTime} Custom Scalar,  you are telling  {Code|elm-graphql} that it is safe to use it in a specific way. In this case, it may be that it can parse it as an ISO-8601 String.

Some other examples would be representing Currency (perhaps {Code|USD}). Again, the underlying representative is just a GraphQL primitive, but you've now given it semantic meaning. And {Code|elm-graphql} is able to take this semantic meaning and turn it into a specific type.

| Subheader
    Custom Scalars for Ids

GraphQL provides a type called {Code|Id}. I recommend ignoring this type and instead creating a Custom Scalar to represent each type of Id in your domain. For example {Code|ProductId} or {Code|UserId}.

Why bother?
| List
    - Nice clear information in the documentation for free
    - Elm can prevent you from passing in a {Code|UserId} where the API requires a {Code|ProductId}

| Subheader
    Custom Scalars as Gate Keepers

Custom Scalars also provide a pinch point that allows you to limit all the knowledge about how to use a certain type to a single place. For example, you can use an Opaque Type to make sure that the only way {Code|USD} is displayed is by asking the {Code|USD.elm} module to display it for you. This gives you confidence that the knowledge of how to turn the underlying data representation for {Code|USD} is not leaked throughout your codebase, which reduces bugs and makes it easier to reason about your code.

If you're not using the Custom Scalar Codecs functionality in {Code|elm-graphql}. Take a look at the official {Link|Custom Scalar Codecs example and instructions | url = https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/blob/master/examples/src/Example07CustomCodecs.elm
 }.

Here's an example illustrating this with {Code|USD}.

| Monospace
    module USD exposing (USD, codec, toString)

    import Graphql.Codec exposing (Codec)
    import Json.Decode exposing (Decoder)
    import Json.Encode


    type USD
        = Dollars Int


    codec : Codec USD
    codec =
        { encoder = encode
        , decoder = decoder
        }


    decoder : Decoder USD
    decoder =
        Json.Decode.map Dollars Json.Decode.int


    encode : USD -> Json.Encode.Value
    encode (Dollars  dollars) =
        Json.Encode.int dollars


    toString : USD -> String
    toString (Dollars  dollars ) =
        "$" ++ String.fromInt dollars

In this hands-on workshop, the author of Elm's type-safe GraphQL query builder library, {Link|dillonkearns\\/elm-graphql|url=https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql}, will walk you through the core concepts and best practices of the library. Check out {Link|Types Without Borders|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=memIRXFSNkU} from the most recent Elm Conf for some of the underlying philosophy of this library. Or you can {Link|read an overview of features of this library|url=https://medium.com/open-graphql/type-safe-composable-graphql-in-elm-b3378cc8d021}.
