Would you like to develop skills to help you with the following challenges?

| List
    - What does the process of architecture look like for an in elm?
    - How do know which parts of your elm code to split out and organize together?
    - How do you keep your app easy to change and hard to break as you grow your non-trivial single-page apps?
    - How do you make working with new elm libraries manageable?
    - How can you use types to fix bugs and prevent new bugs?


In my Growing Elm Modules program, you will develop the habits and skills to address these issues head-on. Because the program is structured around group coaching and battle-tested lessons and exercises, the program is relatively high on learning commitment, and relatively low on financial commitment. You'll come away with more than a knowledge dump. You'll come away with real skills and real improvements to your codebase.

You'll learn through several mediums:
| List
    - Group coaching calls every week
    - Drills to practice core skills
    - Exercises to apply to improve your codebase and get feedback in coaching hours
    - Slack chat with your peers in your program

The program is limited to 5 people, which means you get a good balance of coaching on your specific issues, and learning from other developer's experiences.

    Avoid tweeting social security #'s using elm types

One of the most successful techniques I've seen for making sure you don't break elm code the next time you touch it is a technique I call an Exit Check.

Let's start by taking this primitive String representation:

| Monospace
    type Msg
      = StoreSSN String
      | LogMessage String


And wrapping it in a simple Custom Type.

By the way, in my mailing list I introduce a technique called a *Type Bouncer* that gives you confidence that the value you have actually represents a real SSN. You can signup for free to get that tip and many more like it!

You can subscribe here to get more tips like this one!

| Monospace
    module SSN exposing (SSN)

    type SSN = SSN String

| Monospace
    type Msg
      = StoreSSN SSN
      | LogMessage String

| Subheader
    Exit Checks

So how do we make sure we don't Tweet, log, or otherwise misuse the user's SSN? We control the exits.

If you expose the constructor, then we can pattern match to get the raw SSN. This means that enforcing the rules for how we want to use SSNs leaks out all over our code instead of being in one central place that we can easily maintain.

| Monospace
    -- the (..) exposes the constructor
    module SSN exposing (SSN(..))


So we can unwrap it from outside of the SSN module:
| Monospace
    case ssn of
      SSN rawSsn -> SendTweet rawSsn

Similarly, you can unwrap the raw SSN directly from outside the module if we expose a {Code|toString}.

| Monospace
    module SSN exposing (SSN, toString)

    toString : SSN -> String
    toString (SSN rawSsn) = rawSsn


| Monospace
    SendTweet (SSN.toString ssn)

Think of an Exit Check like the Model in Model-View-Controller frameworks. The Model acts as a gatekeeper that ensures the integrity of all persistence in our app. Similarly, an Exit Check ensures the integrity of a Domain concept throughout our app.

| Subheader
    Control the Exits
To add an Exit Check, all we need to do is define every function needed to use SSNs internally within the `SSN` module. And of course, each of those functions is responsible for using it appropriately. (And on the other side of that coin, that means that the calling code is free of that responsibility!).

Let's make a function to securely send an SSN. We need to guarantee that:
| List
    - The SSN is encrypted using the proper key
    - It is sent to the correct endpoint
    - It is sent with https

We don't want to check for all those things everywhere we call this code every time. We want to be able to make sure the code in this module is good whenever it changes, and then completely trust it from the calling code.

| Monospace
    module SSN exposing (SSN)

    securelySendSsn : Ssn -> Http.Request
    securelySendSsn ssn =
      Http.post
        { url = "https://yoursecuresite.com/secure-endpoint"
        , body = encryptedSsnBody ssn,
        , expect = ...
        }

Now we can be confident that the calling code will never mistakenly send SSNs to the wrong endpoint, or forget to encrypt them!

| Subheader
    Displaying the SSN
What if you only want to display the last 4 digits of the SSN? How do you make sure that you, your team members, and your future self all remember to do that?

You could vigilantly put that in a code review check list, or come up with all sorts of creative heuristics to avoid that mistake. Or you could use our Exit Check pattern, and check very carefully any time you are modifying the SSN module itself.

It's very likely that you'll miss something if you have to think about where SSNs are used throughout your codebase. But it's quite manageable to keep the entire SSN module in your head and feel confident that you're not forgetting anything important.

Here's a simple implementation of our last 4 digits view:

| Monospace
    module SSN exposing (SSN)

    lastFourView : SSN -> Html msg
    lastFourView ssn =
      Html.text ("xxx-xx-" ++ lastFour ssn)

| Subheader
    Takeaways
You can start applying the Exit Check pattern to your elm code right away!

Here are some steps you can apply:

| List
    #. Notice some data in your codebase that you have to be careful to use safely or correctly
    #. Wrap it in a Custom Type (if you haven't already)
    #. Expose the constructor at first to make the change small and manageable
    #. Get everything compiling and committed!
    #. One by one, copy each function that is consuming your new Custom Type and call it from the new module
    #. Once that's done, you can now hide the constructor, and you now have a proper Exit Check for your type!"""

    How to improve your schema with Custom Scalars

| Subheader
    What

Use Custom Scalars instead of GraphQL primitives.

Instead of:

| Monospace
    type Book {
      publicationDate: String!
      priceInCents: Int!

      # cover assets are stored at
      # `/covers/<coverImage>?format=<large|small>`
      coverImage: String!

      averageRating: Float!
      id: String!
    }

Try using Custom Scalars like this:
| Monospace
    type Book {
      publicationDate: DateTime!
      price: USD!
      coverImage: CoverImage!
      averageRating: StarRating!
      id: BookId!
    }

| Subheader
    When

| List
    - You want to transform the value into a particular data structure (e.g. Custom Scalar {Code|DateTime} -> Elm {Code|Time})
    - You want to ensure that a value is not mixed up and passed in where it has the same primitive representation but different semantic meaning (for example, {Code|ProductId} and {Code|UserId} might both be Strings, but if they are Custom Scalars then {Code|elm-graphql} can prevent you from passing in the wrong type.
    - You want to control *how* the data is used. For example a {Code|Temperature} or {Code|USD} Custom Scalar has implementation details (perhaps {Code|USD} is represented in cents, but you don't want to leak that knowledge all over your codebase, you want to keep it in one central location).

| Subheader
    Why

*Custom Scalars are a way of representing a contract.*

For example, a {Code|DateTime} is just a {Code|String} under the hood. But there is a contract. When I call a value a {Code|DateTime}, I am promising that you will always be able to parse it as an ISO-8601 String (or however it is represented in your API).

The data in your GraphQL response will actually be the same. But by using the {Code|DateTime} Custom Scalar,  you are telling  {Code|elm-graphql} that it is safe to use it in a specific way. In this case, it may be that it can parse it as an ISO-8601 String.

Some other examples would be representing Currency (perhaps {Code|USD}). Again, the underlying representative is just a GraphQL primitive, but you've now given it semantic meaning. And {Code|elm-graphql} is able to take this semantic meaning and turn it into a specific type.

| Subheader
    Custom Scalars for Ids

GraphQL provides a type called {Code|Id}. I recommend ignoring this type and instead creating a Custom Scalar to represent each type of Id in your domain. For example {Code|ProductId} or {Code|UserId}.

Why bother?
| List
    - Nice clear information in the documentation for free
    - Elm can prevent you from passing in a {Code|UserId} where the API requires a {Code|ProductId}

| Subheader
    Custom Scalars as Gate Keepers

Custom Scalars also provide a pinch point that allows you to limit all the knowledge about how to use a certain type to a single place. For example, you can use an Opaque Type to make sure that the only way {Code|USD} is displayed is by asking the {Code|USD.elm} module to display it for you. This gives you confidence that the knowledge of how to turn the underlying data representation for {Code|USD} is not leaked throughout your codebase, which reduces bugs and makes it easier to reason about your code.

If you're not using the Custom Scalar Codecs functionality in {Code|elm-graphql}. Take a look at the official {Link|Custom Scalar Codecs example and instructions | url = https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/blob/master/examples/src/Example07CustomCodecs.elm
 }.

Here's an example illustrating this with {Code|USD}.

| Monospace
    module USD exposing (USD, codec, toString)

    import Graphql.Codec exposing (Codec)
    import Json.Decode exposing (Decoder)
    import Json.Encode


    type USD
        = Dollars Int


    codec : Codec USD
    codec =
        { encoder = encode
        , decoder = decoder
        }


    decoder : Decoder USD
    decoder =
        Json.Decode.map Dollars Json.Decode.int


    encode : USD -> Json.Encode.Value
    encode (Dollars  dollars) =
        Json.Encode.int dollars


    toString : USD -> String
    toString (Dollars  dollars ) =
        "$" ++ String.fromInt dollars
